## Front-end migration to React
This app now serves a React single-page application from Flask. The UI has been recreated in React to match the original look and behavior.

- React app entry: static/react/index.html
- React components: static/react/app.jsx (loaded via CDN + Babel for simplicity)
- Styles: static/css/style.css (reused)
- API endpoints provided by Flask:
  - GET /api/search/movie?title=Inception&page=1&sort=popularity&order=desc
  - GET /api/search/tv?title=Breaking%20Bad&page=1&sort=rating&order=desc
- Client routes (hash-based):
  - #/ (home)
  - #/search/movie/:title/:page?sort=&order=
  - #/search/tv/:title/:page?sort=&order=
  - #/watch/movie/:id
  - #/watch/tv/:id

To run locally:
1. Set environment variable TMDB_API_KEY with your TMDB bearer token string (including the "Bearer " prefix).
2. pip install -r requirements.txt (or poetry install)
3. python main.py
4. Open http://localhost:8080 â€” Flask will serve the React app.
